# UI Design Expert

Applies polished UI design principles based on "Refactoring UI" for professional, systematic interfaces.

## What It Does

Claude automatically uses this skill when building or reviewing user interfaces. Provides guidance for:

- Visual hierarchy through weight and color, not just size
- Systematic spacing and typography scales
- HSL-based color palettes with defined shades
- Intentional layout and whitespace decisions

## Usage

```
"Add a delete button to this card"
"Design a pricing table"
"Improve the look of this settings panel"
"Review the visual hierarchy of this component"
```

Claude will apply systematic design principles focusing on hierarchy, consistency, and restraint.

## Core Principles

- **Grayscale first** - Force hierarchy through spacing and contrast before adding color
- **Emphasize by de-emphasizing** - Reduce competing elements rather than over-styling primary ones
- **Establish systems** - Define restrictive scales for fonts, colors, and spacing upfront
